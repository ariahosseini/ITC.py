# InterfacePhononsToolkit â€” a Python Set of Libraries for Computing Phonons Behavior at the Interfaces

<div align="justify">
  
*InterfacePhononsToolkit* is a collection of tools for setting up, performing, analyzing molecular dynamic simulations of heat flow at the interfaces and computing thermodynamic properties of the boundaries. This collection includes a set of libraries to generate phonon Gaussian wavepackets to compute phonon transmission matrices across solid-solid interfaces, a generic Monte Carlo ray tracing model to unveil anticorrelated heat current phenomenon in materials containing nanoscale pores (with a new rigorous mathematical implementation), a set of libraries to analyze lattice vibrational behavior in heterogeneous structures, including atomic partition ratio, local phonon density of state, etc., and a Monte Carlo model to compute phonon lifetime in microstructures. The codes have interface with LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator.
