# InterfacePhononsToolkit â€” a Python Set of Libraries for Computing Thermal Behavior at the Interfaces

<div align="justify">
  
*InterfacePhononsToolkit* is a computational framework for computing phonons behavior at the interfaces. This includes a set of libraries to generate phonon wavepacket, a generic Monte Carlo ray tracing model to demonstrate anticorrelated heat current in materials containing nanoscale pores, a set of libraries to analyze lattice vibrational behavior in inharmonious structures, etc. The code has an interface with LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator. The derivation and implementation of the codes are done in a clever way to minimize the computational expenses while enhancing the accuracy.
