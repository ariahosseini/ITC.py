# InterfacePhononsToolkit â€” a Python Set of Libraries for Computing Thermal Behavior at the Interfaces

<div align="justify">
  
*InterfacePhononsToolkit* is a computational framework for computing phonons behavior at the interfaces. This includes a set of libraries to generate phonon wavepacket, a generic Monte Carlo ray tracing model to demonstrate anticorrelated heat current in materials containing nanoscale pores, a set of libraries to analyze lattice vibrational behavior in inharmonious structures, etc. The code has an interface with LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator. The derivation and implementation of the codes are done in a clever way to minimize the computational expenses while enhancing the accuracy.

is a collection of tools for setting up, performing, analyzing molecular dynamic simulations of heat flow at the interfaces and computing thermodynamic properties of the boundaries. This collection includes a set of libraries to generate phonon Gaussian wavepackets to compute phonon transmission matrices across solid-solid interfaces, a generic Monte Carlo ray tracing model to unveil anticorrelated heat current phenomenon in materials containing nanoscale pores (with a new rigorous mathematical implementation), a set of libraries to analyze lattice vibrational behavior in heterogeneous structures, including atomic partition ratio, local phonon density of state, etc., and a Monte Carlo model to compute phonon lifetime in microstructures. The codes have interface with LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator.
